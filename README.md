A research project that collaborates with the Florida State University's School of Dance to develop a projected interactive environment using Computer Vision with the Microsoft Kinect SDK and Unity3D/C# for demo/testing purposes and OpenCV for open stage. This research was accepted into the Seventh International Conference on Computational Creativity

Extract this into Unity3D/InteractiveDance/Assets  
so the resulting path is:  
Unity3D/InteractiveDance/Assets/ImportedLibraries/(all the files)  

Place all assets here and update the asset file seperately.

Running locally/testing/demoing requires a Microsoft Kinect for Windows or Microsoft Kinect for XBox with the Windows USB Adapter.  
Usage:  
Run the Unity project, the connection will block with a black screen.  
Run the Kinect Visual Studio application.   


Running production requires infrared filters, lights, and infrared camera.
